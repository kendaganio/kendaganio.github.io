# Hello! They call me Ken.

I am a software developer with a penchant for experimentation. 
I have walked my way through most of the web stack and find myself enjoying every bit of it. 
Currently, I am helping 
<a href="https://remotelock.com" target='_blank'>RemoteLock</a>
create smart locks for everyone!
To learn more of what I've done in the past you can do so [here](https://kendaganio.com/cv).

Most of what I do revolves around **Ruby** and **Javascript**, but that doesn't mean I am less open to other technology stacks. 
Nowadays I spend most of my time doing front-end development, mostly with **React** and it's ecosystem.

Writing is my first love, but I wish I'm more diligent about it. 
You can see some of my tech-related write ups [here]({{ 'posts' | relative_url }}); or if food and travel is what you fancy, 
I also contribute to the 
<a href="https://gastrotravelers.com" target="_blank">gastrotravelers</a>
blog.

If you want to reach out for anything, 
you can find me in the interwebs at the handle **@kendaganio**, 
or shoot me an e-mail at hi@kendaganio.com
