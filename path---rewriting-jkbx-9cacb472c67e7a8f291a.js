This sets up a good excuse to learn Vue!</p>\n<p>Vue was created by this dude <a href="https://github.com/yyx990803">Evan You</a>, who at the time was working for Google and Angular.\nHe pulled out what he liked about Angular, added in a virtual DOM, stripped it down to remove all the cruft he wouldn\'t\nneed, and made it really lightweight. My first impression was that it really reminds me of the Angular of yore.\nThe prefixed directives, the two-way binding, models, and controllers.
